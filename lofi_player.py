        ### Why Lofi?

        Lofi (low-fidelity) music often features calming melodies, steady beats (usually without lyrics), and sometimes subtle background noise (like rain or vinyl crackle). Many people find it helps with:

        - **Focus:** The predictable, non-distracting nature can help concentration during work or study.
        - **Relaxation:** Creates a chill, cozy atmosphere, reducing stress and anxiety.
        - **Sleep:** Gentle lofi tracks can be a soothing background sound for falling asleep.
        - **Mood Setting:** Instantly makes a space feel more comfortable and calm.

        ### How to Use This Page

        1.  **Select a Stream:** Choose a vibe that matches your current mood or task.
