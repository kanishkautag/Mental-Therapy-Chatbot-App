First, let me just acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel nervous and anxious about presenting in front of an audience - especially when facing something new or challenging like a presentation. It's natural to worry about sounding perfect on stage, but remember that the goal isn't to wow everyone with your words, it's to share your ideas clearly and confidently. To help you build some confidence, why not try breaking down your presentation into smaller sections and practicing each one in front of a mirror or with friends - this can really help you get comfortable with different scenarios? Also, take some deep breaths before the actual performance to calm any stage anxiety, it might sound silly but trust me when I say it works! Just focus on delivering clear and concise information rather than trying to impress everyone."

It sounds like this situation is really weighing on your mind and causing a lot of distress for you - I want to acknowledge the effort it takes to navigate these feelings without getting stuck in them. You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed, lots of people struggle with similar concerns. Writing down your thoughts and worries before bed can be super helpful, it's like giving yourself permission to process everything that's on your mind at night. By doing this consistently over time you'll start to see patterns emerge and gain some clarity on things bothering you - just a thought for now though let's explore what else might be going on in this situation together?"

That can be a really painful and isolating experience, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed with emotions right now. It sounds like the loss of a job can also trigger feelings of uncertainty about our purpose in life - I want you to remember that there are always other paths forward, even if they don't look like what your current role did. One practical step you could take is to start exploring new career options or freelance work – it might help shift your focus away from the loss and towards possibilities. Try setting aside some time each day to brainstorm ideas, even just for 10 minutes - sometimes getting things out of our heads can be really helpful in clarifying our thoughts. This will give you a sense of control over what's next and take one step closer to finding yourself again"

I can imagine how frustrating it must be to feel like you're not doing well enough in a situation where you know something new is on the horizon. It sounds like the pressure of trying something new and potentially failing is really weighing on you right now. Take a deep breath, because breaking down that problem into smaller parts might just help your mind relax and make it easier to tackle one step at a time. You could start by writing down key concepts related to the problem - what are some things you're not sure about or need to remember? By doing so, you'll be able to focus on relearning those details without getting overwhelmed by too much information all at once."

I want you to know that it's okay not to have all the answers or reactions - just being honest about what happened is a huge step forward. Writing down your thoughts and details can help clarify your feelings and make discussing them later easier. Consider keeping a notebook or journal where you jot down any questions, concerns, or emotions that come up as you think more about this experience. This will give you time to process your emotions without feeling overwhelmed by the situation - just be patient with yourself and take things one step at a time."
