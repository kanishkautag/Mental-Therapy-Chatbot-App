First, let me just acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel nervous and anxious about presenting in front of an audience - especially when facing something new or challenging like a presentation. It's natural to worry about sounding perfect on stage, but remember that the goal isn't to wow everyone with your words, it's to share your ideas clearly and confidently. To help you build some confidence, why not try breaking down your presentation into smaller sections and practicing each one in front of a mirror or with friends - this can really help you get comfortable with different scenarios? Also, take some deep breaths before the actual performance to calm any stage anxiety, it might sound silly but trust me when I say it works! Just focus on delivering clear and concise information rather than trying to impress everyone."

It sounds like this situation is really weighing on your mind and causing a lot of distress for you - I want to acknowledge the effort it takes to navigate these feelings without getting stuck in them. You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed, lots of people struggle with similar concerns. Writing down your thoughts and worries before bed can be super helpful, it's like giving yourself permission to process everything that's on your mind at night. By doing this consistently over time you'll start to see patterns emerge and gain some clarity on things bothering you - just a thought for now though let's explore what else might be going on in this situation together?"
