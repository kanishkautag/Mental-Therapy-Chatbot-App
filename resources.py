        ### Understanding Stress
        
        Stress is your body's reaction to pressure from certain situations or events in your life. When you feel threatened, a chemical reaction occurs in your body that allows you to act in a way to prevent injury. This reaction is known as "fight-or-flight," and it's meant to protect you.
        
        ### Healthy Stress Management Techniques
        
        - **Deep breathing**: Breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 1 count, and exhale through your mouth for 5 counts. Repeat 5-10 times.
        
        - **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Tense each muscle group for 5 seconds, then relax for 30 seconds, working from your toes up to your head.
        
        - **Time management**: Prioritize tasks, break large projects into smaller steps, and learn to say no to additional commitments when necessary.
        
        - **Connect with others**: Share your concerns with friends, family members, or support groups.
        
        - **Limit exposure to stressors**: Identify sources of stress and create boundaries around them when possible.
