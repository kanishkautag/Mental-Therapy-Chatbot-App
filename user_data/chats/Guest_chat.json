You deserve support and understanding - first, let me tell you how much I care about you and want to help in any way I can. In terms of immediate action, consider reaching out to someone close who'll listen without judgment or criticism. Try writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal; it might help clarify things for you later on too. Take some time before bed tonight to focus on taking care of yourself - that means making sure everything is okay with the people around you first.\""
