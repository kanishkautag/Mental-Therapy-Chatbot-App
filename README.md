## Technical Architecture

The application uses a multi-agent LLM architecture in its chat component:
- **Empathy Agent**: Provides emotional validation and support
- **Practical Agent**: Offers concrete, actionable suggestions when appropriate
- **Supervisor Agent**: Combines the outputs of both agents into natural-sounding responses

Data is stored locally in JSON format, with separate files for user profiles, chat history, and journal entries.
